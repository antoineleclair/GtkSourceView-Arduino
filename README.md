GtkSourceView-Arduino
========================

This is the language spec file needed for syntax highlighting of the Arduino programming language. This is basically just a copy of `c.lang` with the metadata changed for `.pde` files.

Copy `arduino.lang` in the language spec folder. In Ubuntu it's `/usr/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs/`.
